# MiSeq extended demultiplex summary
> This Python script converts a DemultiplexSummaryF1L1.txt file into a .csv document with more content

One output file of a Illumina MiSeq sequencing run is the DemultiplexSummaryF1L1.txt file. In this text document are (among other things) the most frequent index sequences listed.  
One thing which is not included, is a translation from the index sequence to a index name.  
This script has the goal to change that and make it therefore more readable and useful for interpretation during troubleshooting.
